<!-- ---------Tips-------------- -->

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>By not moving a chess piece a lot of times during opening, you are developing that piece, and you should not move it until after developing the other pieces. Remember to develop pieces that can coordinate properly with one another. Otherwise, your attack may not be strong enough and cause you to fail.</i></li>
    <li><i>Fight the urge to make premature attacks on your opponent. Beginners typically lose because they disregard that principle. Keep in mind that an attack must never be done until you have enough force in your field to ensure its success. Attacking prematurely usually results in the move backfiring.</i></li>
    <li><i>Stay grounded and do not be selfish. There are times when you may encounter an easy pawn, but it could be a poisoned pawn or a trap, which could give your opponent the opportunity to make a powerful attack. To neutralize the attack, return the material instead of holding on.</i></li>
    <li><i>Look for a weak spot in the position of your opponent. This is one of the most important abilities you must learn in advanced chess strategy.</i></li>
    <li><i>Do not make exchanges that can lead to your opponent developing another piece. Instead, exchange an inactive piece with the same but active piece from your opponent.</i></li>
    <li><i>Never castle in when you are in a endgame. You need a very active king, your king has to be walking around everywhere. All your pieces(including pawn and king) should be moving</i></li>
  </ul>
